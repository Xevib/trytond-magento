Configuration
=============

The module requires certain initial configuration to be done in
`magento instance`_ to set the management tool.

.. _magento instance:

**Magento instance**
---------------------

Go to ``Magento`` and and click *Magento Instances* on the
left menu.

It refers to a magento installation identifiable after setting the API for
``Magento Site URL``, ``API User`` and ``API Password / Key``

1. Create a new ``Magento instance`` by clicking create.

    .. image:: _images/create_magento_instance.png
       :width: 800

   Give the Magento instance a title(i.e. Name), company and API settings which
   includes magento site URL, API user and API password. Magento Site URL is the
   URL used to access Store pages. You can set it on a per Store basis.

2. After filling the record, now click on the ``Save`` button to save the
   record.

3. After this, the Connection can be tested by clicking on  ``Test Connection``
   button at the bottom.

4. If the connection with magento is successful, a window will pop-up
   showing successful installation:

    **It will also import all the order states, website stores and store views
    related to this website.**

  5a. *Order States*: This allows the user to configure the states mapping
  according to his/her convenience. This map is used to process orders in
  Tryton when they are imported. This is also used to map the order status on
  magento when sales are exported. This also allows the user to determine in
  which state he/she wants the order to be imported in. Refer below for all
  order states that are generated after the websites are imported.

  User can use the default order states map, Refer `table`_ for default
  order states. The states map can be changed at his/her convenience.

is managed in magento at store level by specifying the root category on a store.
A store can have multiple store views.

.. note::
    A store must be unique in a website

Click on any store. You will see an "Export tier prices' icon.

.. image:: _images/export_tier_prices.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

What is Price Tier?

Price Tier on a source represents the default value to be used while sending
tier prices for a product from Tryton to Magento. The product also has a
similar table like this in Magento. If there are no entries in the table of the
product, then these tiers are used.

| **what is tier pricing?**

Tier pricing is a tool that allows you to set different prices for items of
higher quantities. For example: You sell stationery supplies  and want to offer
a deal wherein, if the customer buys three or more paper products, then he/she
can save money when compared to buying just only one. Now, import these tier
prices to the Magento store.:

views for different languages.

``Store``
