How it Works
============

This section explains how import and export of orders between Tryton and
Magento works. First, lets start with creating the sale orders:

Create Sale Orders in Magento
-----------------------------

Under the 'Sales' tab in the Magento admin panel, click on 'Create New Order'
button. This will allow you to add sale orders to your products. The order
process consists of several simple steps. You can start by adding an item to the
cart, then proceed to checkout. After that, select a checkout method, fill the
billing and shipping information, select a payment method and place the order.
See below how to `Create New Order`_.

Orders are imported as Sales
----------------------------

Orders placed in Magento Admin Panel are imported in Tryton from ``Store
View``. See below:

An order in Magento has a number of entities related to it which are
imported in Tryton as described below:

* The Order is imported as a Sale. The sale in Tryton can be identified by
  the Order Number which will be same as the order reference in Magento.
  Internally the matching is done using the ID of the order as generated by
  Magento.

* The date on which the order is generated.

* The Customer who placed the order as a Sale.

* The products, i.e., the products bought in the order by the customer are
  imported as Sale lines. The product in each of these lines is created as
  product in Tryton, if it does not already exist.

A window pop-ups to import all sale orders placed on this store view.
Enter Continue, refer screenshot shown below:

.. note::
   When the order import takes place again, the changes in the state of the
   orders in Magento will be updated in Tryton.


Cancellation Of Sale Order
--------------------------

You can edit an order by clicking on it and modify it to your preference. To
cancel the order click on ``Cancel``:

.. image:: _images/cancel_sale_order.png

   :align: center

Now state has been changed to cancelled, see below

**Cancelled Sale Order**

Now to export the changes to Magento, refer `export order`_

.. _export order:

Exporting Order Status from Tryton to Magento
----------------------------------------------

Once the order is processed in Tryton, the shipping status of the order
based on delivery is updated on Magento by Export Order.

.. image:: _images/export_order_status.png
   :width: 800
   :align: center

This will export order's status to magento for this store view

* The status of orders which are imported in Tryton will be exported to
  Magento as `Cancelled` once they are marked `Cancelled` by editing sale order
  from Tryton.

.. note::
   This feature is currently available for Cancelled Orders
